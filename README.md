## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a **Senior Software Engineer and Delivery Lead** with **10+ years of experience** designing and deploying scalable microservices and cloud-native platforms across logistics, e-commerce, and enterprise domains. I led multiple modernization programs on Java, Spring Boot, and cloud stacks, cutting API latency by 40%, increasing throughput by 3.3x, and improving release frequency from monthly to bi-weekly through CI/CD, while acting as a technical authority for complex migrations and system upgrades. Recent work focuses on **Generative AI**, including **Prompt Engineering**, **RAG**, and **AI Agents**, integrating LLMs into production systems to automate workflows and enhance developer and business productivity.
